**Introduction**

This code demonstrates the use of decorators in Python. Decorators are a powerful tool that allows you to modify the behavior of a function without changing its source code. In this example, we will use a decorator to add a greeting message before and after the execution of a function.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Defining the Decorator Function**:

```python
def greet(fx):
    def mfx(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Good morning")
        fx(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Thanks for the function")
    return mfx
```

- The `greet` function is the decorator function. It takes a function as its argument and returns a new function that wraps the original function.
- The inner function `mfx` is the modified function that will be executed when the decorated function is called.
- The `mfx` function prints a greeting message before and after calling the original function `fx`.

2. **Applying the Decorator**:

```python
@greet
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

@greet
def add(a, b):
    print(a + b)
```

- The `@greet` decorator is applied to the `hello` and `add` functions.
- This means that when the `hello` and `add` functions are called, the `greet` decorator will be executed first, which will print the greeting message.

3. **Calling the Decorated Functions**:

```python
hello()
add(1, 2)
```

- When the `hello` function is called, the `greet` decorator prints the greeting message, then calls the `hello` function, which prints "Hello, world!", and finally prints the thank you message.
- When the `add` function is called, the `greet` decorator prints the greeting message, then calls the `add` function, which prints the sum of 1 and 2, and finally prints the thank you message.

**Output**

The output of the code is as follows:

```
Good morning
Hello, world!
Thanks for the function
Good morning
3
Thanks for the function
```
