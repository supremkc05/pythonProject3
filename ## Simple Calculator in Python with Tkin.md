 ## Simple Calculator in Python with Tkinter

This project demonstrates the creation of a simple calculator application using Python and the Tkinter library. The calculator features basic arithmetic operations and provides a user-friendly interface.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3 or later
- Tkinter library (usually pre-installed in Python)

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Importing the Tkinter Library**:
   ```python
   import tkinter as tk
   ```
   This line imports the Tkinter library and assigns it the alias `tk`. Tkinter is a standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

2. **Defining the Button Click Function**:
   ```python
   def button_click(value):
       current = str(entry.get())
       entry.delete(0, tk.END)
       entry.insert(0, current + str(value))
   ```
   This function is called whenever a button is clicked. It takes the value of the clicked button as an argument.
   - `current` stores the current text in the entry widget.
   - `entry.delete(0, tk.END)` clears the entry widget.
   - `entry.insert(0, current + str(value))` inserts the current text and the value of the clicked button into the entry widget.

3. **Defining the Button Clear Function**:
   ```python
   def button_clear():
       entry.delete(0, tk.END)
   ```
   This function is called when the "C" (clear) button is clicked. It simply clears the entry widget.

4. **Defining the Button Equal Function**:
   ```python
   def button_equal():
       try:
           current = entry.get()
           result = eval(current)
           entry.delete(0, tk.END)
           entry.insert(0, result)
       except Exception as e:
           entry.delete(0, tk.END)
           entry.insert(0, "Error")
   ```
   This function is called when the "=" (equal) button is clicked. It evaluates the expression entered in the entry widget and displays the result.
   - `try` block attempts to evaluate the expression.
   - `except` block catches any exceptions (e.g., invalid expression) and displays "
